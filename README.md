# python-api-challenge
This is the homework to dive deeper with the OpenWeather API as well as the Google Places API.
As we work with the weather API we are determining the weather stats for randomly generated cities based on latitude and longitude.

The Vacation API work uses these generated weather stats. Once we read the generated csv file we filter down the cities to match our favorite weather conditions and then use Google Place API to find the closest Hotel to the city.
